## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**The Expression Calculator** is a project that evaluates mathematical expressions entered by the user. It supports operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. The system uses stack-based evaluation to handle operator precedence and associativity, making it a practical example of applying Data Structures to real-world problems.
